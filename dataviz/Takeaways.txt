# Take aways from this tutorial

1. Understanding what your library does to/with an object using built in methods and functions (ex: csv-data is an iterator)

2. Break up the "parts" of your input(ex. "Let's first address our column headers that came with the CSV file" So, headers receive the variable name fields)

3. The general rule of ordering imports, in alphabetical order

4. When importing, we can also give the object we’re importing whatever name we want because we’re lazy programmers. When we import matplotlib.pyplot as plt we’re essentially renaming the pyplot object

5. Take Note:

    A package is a collection of modules (or packages). A module is one python file, so a package is a collection of python files within the same directory.
    A distributed collection of packages is can be referred to as a library.

In case I ever want to make my own library.
